      My name is Nicole. I’ve been doing cleaning on and off for around 5 years now. I stopped when I decided to open my own business. Unfortunately due to covid that went downhill so I have started to clean again.
      I love a great end result and I feel like cleaning is my role. I’ve never received a complaint and I can say with a great smile on my face that i have always completed a job within the estimated time frame.
      I can work around your schedule. I’m okay with pets and children. I understand babysitters are not always at hand so please don’t feel bothered by this.
